# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The main goal of this project is to introduce us to the actual, real world raw data and how we can convert this data to a meaningful, structured and accurate format. Gave us opportunity to combine all our learnings and implement these in our own way. We Clean,Analyse and make Predictions.
Make this presentable using visualizations,create attractive and interactive Dashboards to impress stackholders and get the meaningful conclusion from it.This is a subset of the challenges we have to face while analysing and presenting real world problem. On the top of it we learn to work in a group which was so exciting.

## Process
### Selecting Data: 
We choose the Kaggle's Dataset [Suicide rate and life expectancy](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marshuu/suicide-rate-and-life-expectancy). We thought the this dataset could produce interesting outcomes.
### Exploring: 
We start with deep diving into data to get the better understanding of the dataset. We start exploring the each table and then column of the table and try to be more familiar with it. For this we use two tools. At first we use capabilities of python to understand the data also side by side we use Tableau to make some graphs(Blue colored worksheets) to figure out the data structure. We also use Excel as our dataset is in .csv format.
### Cleaning:
Then we start with the cleaning process. Initially we start with the easy going cleaning which are easy to detect and fix. For example eliminating NULL valued rows, removing duplicate rows & columns, deleting null columns. Python is a great tool to do that in no-time. We have also detect some pattern in data using Tableau plots. for example We found some of the country names are misspelled.
### Analysing:
We analyse 
  - Countries 
  - Suicide Rate
  - Life Expactancy
  - GDP Per Capita
  - Fertility Rate
  - Happiness Score
  using plots and showme tables to get the more insite about the Data.
### Questions:
We decide to explain following questions (Green colored sheets):
 - Which Countries have more Suicide Rates?
 - Does High GDP Per Capita means Higher Fertility Rate?
 - Top 10 Happiest Countries in the World.
 - Do happy people live longer?
 - Compare Men/Women Life Expectancy of various countries.
 - Can High GDP Per Capita saves People from Suicide?
### Interesting Facts about data:
while working with this data I found some interesting outcomes.
- In most of the countries women lives longer than men.
- A strong GDP Per Capita could reduce the Suicide Rate.

## Results
I succeed to find the answers of the above questions clearly using an interactive dashboard. With this dashboard stackholders could easily detect the impact of various factors over Suicide Rate and Life Expectancy.

## Challenges 
- The data does not contains information about All the countries.
- It also does not contains Yearly or Monthly based information.

## Future Goals
We would like to connect this dataset with the some time series information and like to explore the forcasting as well.
